# Mitogenomes_Leptodiaptomus

Here, we have deposited all the scripts and documents used to generate the results associated with the research:  
**A landscape of contrasts in the evolution of the mitogenome in Copepoda**  

The scripts are organized in the same order as the results in the article and are located in the [`./bin`](./bin) folder.  

Some of the data required to run the scripts can be found in the `./data/` folder.  

Finally, some of the results are stored in the `./results/` folder, although all results are available in Urban *et al.* 2025.
